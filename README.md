Advanced Weather Platform 🌦️
Welcome to the Advanced Weather Platform, a powerful Streamlit-based web application that delivers real-time, actionable weather insights for professionals in agriculture, transportation, construction, and more. Powered by WeatherAPI.com, this platform provides comprehensive weather data, advanced analytics, and sector-specific decision support, all with a user-friendly, multilingual interface.
Features ✨

Real-Time Weather Data: Access current weather conditions for cities worldwide, with "New Delhi, India" as the default location 📍.
Weather Forecasts: View dynamic forecasts for up to 14 days, including temperature, precipitation, wind, and more 📅.
Historical Data: Analyze past weather trends with metrics like Growing Degree Days (GDD) and temperature anomalies 📊.
Interactive Visualizations: Explore data through Plotly charts, heatmaps, and Folium maps 🗺️.
Sector-Specific Decision Support: Get tailored recommendations for Agriculture 🌾, Transportation 🚚, Construction 🏗️, Energy, Tourism, Emergency Management, and Health.
Multilingual Support: Use the platform in English, Hindi, Spanish, or French 🌐.
Advanced Analytics: Calculate GDD, heat index, wind chill, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), and precipitation probability using machine learning (RandomForestClassifier) and time-series forecasting (Prophet).
Export Options: Download charts, data (CSV/JSON), and decision support reports (LaTeX/text).
